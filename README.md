**#üè° AirBnB Clone Project**
  **Project Description**
    
    This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. 
    The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, 
    view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, 
    backend APIs, database design, and deployment.
    
üìå **Project Overview**

     Objective The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable 
     foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. 
     This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, 
     ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

**CI/CD Pipeline**

    A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery/Deployment) pipeline is an automated workflow 
    in software development that streamlines the process of integrating code, testing it, 
    and deploying it to production. It combines Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), 
    and sometimes Continuous Deployment. CI involves frequent merging of code changes into a shared 
    repository and running automated tests. CD automates the release and rollout of the application 
    after integration, while Deployment is the automated release to production. 

**üìÑ Primary Pages**

  |Page	                  |Description|
  |----------------------|-------------|
  | Property Listing View	   |- Grid display of available properties with filters|
  |Listing Detailed View	   |- Complete property details with images and booking form|
  |Simple Checkout View	    |- Streamlined payment and booking confirmation|

**Importance of User-Friendly Design**

   A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, increases conversion rates, 
   and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are critical for success.
